Why is a graph the right structure to represent a social network?
A graph makes sense because people can connect to each other in any direction, just like in real life. 
There’s no order or levels when it comes to friendships. Everyone can be connected to multiple people at the same time, 
and that’s exactly how graphs work.

Why wouldn’t a list or tree work as well for this?
A list and a tree are way too limited for this. A list is just one straight line, and a tree is like a parent → child hierarchy. 
But friendships don’t follow a chain or a ranking. People don’t follow a single path. So those structures wouldn’t 
match how social networks actually work.


What performance or structural trade-offs did you notice when adding friends or printing the network?
Adding friends is super simple because it’s just adding each person to the other person’s friend list. 
But when printing the whole network, we have to loop through everyone and go through all their friends. 
So printing becomes more expensive the bigger the network gets. It’s a trade-off: easy adding, but heavier printing.
